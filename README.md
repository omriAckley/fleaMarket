This is the newest version of the flea market simulator.

To see a demo run, evaluate the whole core file, then uncomment under the "example" section and evaluate those lines.

Previous versions allowed for singular isolated simulations of one population, which made contextualizing results very difficult.
This version allows for simulations composed of multiple sub-populations (called "clans"), which interact on a flexible and user-defined schedule.

This new version also has changed from mostly immutable data to mostly mutable data.
As such, changes that used to be ephemeral are now conserved and viewable.
